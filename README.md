Classifcation of Normal and Peri-implantitis Disease Using R-Language

Analyzing the taxanomic composition of peri-implantitis vs Normal from Saliva samples. Alpha diversity provides insights into thee diversity within individual samples while utilizing Shannon index and Beta-diversity analysis include PCA and PCoA, which differentiate in microbial community struture between healthy and diseased samples (peri-implantitis). Followed by Differential abundance analysis and Modelling & prediction.
Which done the distributional characteristics, unconditiontional associations, Booststrapping, and Output is prediction **probability**
