Classifcation of Normal and Peri-implantitis Disease Using R-Language

this study aims to analyzing the taxanomic composition of peri-implantitis vs Normal from Saliva samples. Alpha-diversity provides insights in diversity within individual samples while utilizing Shannon index. Beta-diversity analysis include PCA and PCoA, which differentiate in microbial community struture between healthy and diseased samples (peri-implantitis). Followed by Differential abundance analysis and Modelling & prediction.
Through distributional characteristics, unconditiontional associations,and Booststrapping, the Output is predict **probability**.
